Put some numbers on those git commands!

Git-by-id annotates the standard git output with "id annotations" (a.k.a. numbers) that make it easier to add, reset, checkout, rm, diff. Once you set the ids for the current index via `git status` or `git branch` the ids can be used instead of the file or branch names.

# Example



```shell
$ git status -u
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	[1] +modified:   git-by-id

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	[2] .gitignore
	[3] README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```shell
$ git add 1,3
add 'git-by-id'
add '.gitignore'
add 'README.md'
```

```shell
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	[1] +new file:   .gitignore
	[2] +new file:   README.md
	[3] +modified:   git-by-id

Untracked files not listed (use -u option to show untracked files)
```

# Configuration

All config will be held in the `GIT_BY_ID` config map. Once the setup is run for the first time `GIT_BY_ID` will be marked `readonly` for safety.

### `GIT_BY_ID[GIT]`
> Default: `git`

The command used to run all underlying git commands. The validity of this will be checked via `$+commands[${GIT_BY_ID[GIT]}]`. This check is skipped if `GIT_BY_ID[GIT_CMD]` is already configured.

### `GIT_BY_ID[GIT_CMD]`
> Default: `$commands[$GIT_BY_ID[GIT]]`

Setting this is only necessary if `GIT_BY_ID[GIT]` is not discoverable at the time of first run.

This is the full path to the git executable, this variable is what git-by-id uses internally to call git.

### `GIT_BY_ID[LOG_COMMANDS]` and 
> Default: `0`

Enables a debug log of every git-by-id command run (with timestamps).

### `GIT_BY_ID[LOGFILE]`
> Default: `/usr/local/var/log/git-bid.log`

Location of debug logfile.

### `GIT_BY_ID[SET_ID_VARS]`
> Default: `1`

should id variables (`g23`, etc.) be set when creating the ids

### `GIT_BY_ID[PREFIX_VAR]`
> Default: `g`

The git id variable prefix, defaults to "g"

### `GIT_BY_ID[ALIAS_*]`
Git-by-id will attempt to unwrap aliases so it can do the right thing with respect to processing output and adding ids. If it isn't picking up on one of your aliases it can be manually added to the config.

For an alias of `alias.st=status` you could add `GIT_BY_ID[ALIAS_st]=status` to the config.
# TODOs
Some housekeeping up front

- [ ] make debug output configurable
- [ ] write a good usage/help function
- [ ] make colors configurable and optional
- [ ] disable colors when in a pipe
- [ ] remove non-zsh code where possible (some work is done in ruby and awk)

# Install

## Manual

Do some git cloning and put `git-by-id` on you  `fpath`

And In your `.zshrc` or something put this
```zsh
autoload git-by-id
alias git='git-by-id'
```

## zinit

```shell
zinit load northisup/git-by-id
```

# Other Features

## `next` branch

Git-by-id will substitute the word `next` for an incrementing number.

```sh
$ git checkout -b next
Switched to a new branch 'northisup/15'

$ git checkout -b cool-feature-name/next
Switched to a new branch 'cool-feature-name/15'

$ git checkout -b cool-feature-name/next-some-description
Switched to a new branch 'cool-feature-name/15-some-description'
```

## Alias Aware

Git-by-id will read your git config to make sure it act
```
+> [git st -> git status]
On branch reports/1-get-message-id
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/reports/1-get-message-id'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	[1] +modified:   discord_api/discord/lib/flask_content_cop.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
